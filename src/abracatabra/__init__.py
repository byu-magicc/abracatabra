abracatabra
===========
A package for creating tabbed plot windows with matplotlib in a Qt environment.

Windows can be created with one or more tab groups. Each tab group can contain
one or more tabs, where is tab is a matplotlib Figure. The library provides
functions to show all open windows, update them, and a fun `abracatabra`
function to display all windows with a magical touch.

This package provides:
- `TabbedPlotWindow`: The main class for creating and managing tabbed plot windows.
- `show_all_windows`: Displays all open tabbed plot windows.
- `update_all_windows`: Updates all open tabbed plot windows.
- `animate_all_windows`: Animates all open tabbed plot windows based on
    registered callbacks.
- `abracatabra`: A fun function to display all open tabbed plot windows.
- `is_interactive`: Checks if the current environment is interactive
    (e.g., IPython or Jupyter).
- `__version__`: The version of the abracatabra package.

            closed, either individually or by pressing <ctrl+c> in the terminal.

    Updates all open tabbed plot windows. This is similar to pyplot.pause()
    and is generally used to update the figure in a loop, e.g., an animation.
    This function only updates active tabs in each window, so inactive tabs are
    skipped to save time.

    Args:
        delay_seconds: The minimum delay in seconds before returning. If
            windows are updated faster than this, this function will block until
            `delay_seconds` seconds have passed. If the windows take longer than
            `delay_seconds` seconds to update, the function execution time will
            be greater than `delay_seconds`.
        callback_idx: An index passed to registered animation callbacks to
            specify which frame to draw.

    Returns:
        update_time: The amount of time (seconds) taken to update the windows.

    """
    Animates all created windows by repeatedly calling `update_all_windows()` in
    a loop for the given number of frames. This is a convenience function for
    simple animations. For this to work well, you should have already
    registered animation callbacks for each tab that will be animated.

    Args:
        frames: The number of frames to animate.
        ts (seconds): The time step between frames in seconds. The intention
            is that this time step matches real time, e.g., a simulation
            that saves data every `ts` seconds.
        step: The step size between frames. For example, if you want to animate
            every 2nd frame, set step=2. This is useful if your animation is
            running slower than real time and you want to draw batches of data
            between a single frame.
        speed_scale: A scaling factor for the speed of the animation.
            For example, if speed_scale=2.0, the animation will run twice as
            fast (i.e., half the time step between frames), meaning that a
            10 sec simulation should take 5 sec to animate.
        print_timing: If True, prints timing information for each frame, including
            the running animation time and wall time. Also prints hints after the
            animation is done on how to improve performance if the animation is
            running slower than real time.
        use_player: Specifies whether to use an animation player window with media
            controls (play, pause, step, etc.) to control the animation. If an
            animation player has already been added to a tab, it will be used
            (even if `use_player` is False); otherwise, a new animation player
            window will be created.
        hold: Specify whether to keep the windows open (blocking code) at the last
            frame when the animation is complete. Essentially whether to call
            `show_all_windows()` at the end or not.

    Opens a file dialog that will display all tabs with registered animation
    callbacks and allow you to save the animation for each tab as a video file.
    This function uses `matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation` under the hood, so
    it may not be the most efficient way to save animations, but it is a convenient way to save animations without having to manually create `FuncAnimation` objects for each tab. Note that this function will save the animation for all tabs with registered animation callbacks, so if you only want to save the animation for a specific tab, you should use `FuncAnimation` directly on that tab's figure.
